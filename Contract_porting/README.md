# Solidity Contract porting to Move
This directory contains three Move projects that have been ported from Solidity. The three projects are popular Blockchain application ideas, namely:
- Supplychain
- DAO
- Automatic Market Maker (AMM) (TODO)

## Goal 
The goal of these porting experiments was to identify key Solidity concepts and how they can be represented in Move. The ultimate goal is to be able to define rules to automate the porting process in the future.
